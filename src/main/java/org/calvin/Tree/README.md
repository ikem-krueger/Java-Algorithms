## Traversal

Shows Preorder, Inorder, Postorder Depth First Search and Breath First Search using Binary Tree

## Trie

Shows basic implementation of Trie

## Balanced

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

## BFS

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example:
Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

return its level order traversal as:

```
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]
```

## BFS2

Given a binary tree, return the *bottom-up* level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

For example:
Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

return its bottom-up level order traversal as:

```
[
  [15,7],
  [9,20],
  [3]
]
```

## FindClosestNumber
## InvertTree

Invert a binary tree.

```
     4
   /   \
  2     7
 / \   / \
1   3 6   9
```

to

```
     4
   /   \
  7     2
 / \   / \
9   6 3   1
```

## LCABST

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

```
        _______6______
       /              \
    ___2__          ___8__
   /      \        /      \
   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5
```
         
For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes `2` and `8` is `6`. Another example is LCA of nodes `2` and `4` is `2`, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

## LCABT

Given a binary tree (not a binary search tree) and two values say n1 and n2, write a program to find the least common ancestor.

## MaxDepth

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## MinDepth

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

## Path

Given a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths.

For example, given the following binary tree:

```
   1
 /   \
2     3
 \
  5
```

All root-to-leaf paths are:

`["1->2->5", "1->3"]`

## PathSum

Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

For example:
Given the below binary tree and `sum = 22`,

```
              5
             / \
            4   8
           /   / \
          11  13  4
         /  \      \
        7    2      1
```

return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path `5->4->11->2` which sum is 22.

## SameTree

Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are equal or not.

Two binary trees are considered equal if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

## Symmetric

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree `[1,2,2,3,4,4,3]` is symmetric:

```
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
```

But the following `[1,2,2,null,3,null,3]` is not:

```
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
```
