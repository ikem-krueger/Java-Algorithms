# Mth-toLast Element of a Linked List

## Problem

Given a singly linked list, devise a time- and space-efficient algorithm to find the mth-to-last element of the list.

Implelment your algorith, taking care to handle relevant error conditions.
Define mth such that when m = 0 then last element of the list is returned.
