# Arrays and Strings

Arrays and strings are closely related. In the abstract sense, a string is just a (possibly readonly) array of characters.
Most of the string-manipulation problems you envounter are based on your understanding of array data types, particulary in C where strings and character arrays are essentially identical.

## Arrays
An array is a sequence of variables of the same type arranged contiguously in a block of memory.
