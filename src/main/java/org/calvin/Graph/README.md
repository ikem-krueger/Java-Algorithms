## Dijkstra

Dijkstra algorithm which is to search shortest path in a graph that carries edge with a weight.

## BfsDfs

Breadth First Search vs Depth First Search using Graphs. It shows the differences between the 2 in one class.

## Graph

Interface to the implementation, GraphImpl

## GraphType

Graph can be either UNDIRECTED or DIRECTED.

## Node

Node to carry the actual vertex information: node's key and state, incoming edges, adjacent weights, adjacent nodes

## Shortest Path

Implementation of another Dijikstra using existing graph functionality.

## State

Enum to show different state of the graph

## Topological sort

Shows a path sorting for DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).
