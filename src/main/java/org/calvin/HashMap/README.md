## Bar Problem

At a popular bar, each customer has a set of favorite drinks, and will happily accept any drink among this set. 

For example, in the following situation, customer 0 will be satisfied with drinks 0, 1, 3, or 6.

```
preferences = {
0: [0, 1, 3, 6],
1: [1, 4, 7],
2: [2, 4, 7, 5],
3: [3, 2, 5],
4: [5, 8]
}
```

A lazy bartender working at this bar is trying to reduce his effort by limiting the drink recipes he must memorize. 

Given a dictionary input such as the one above, return the fewest number of drinks he must learn in order to satisfy all customers.

For the input above, the answer would be 2, as drinks 1 and 5 will satisfy everyone.

## IntersectionHashMap

Given 2 int arrays, returns 1 array that contains all items intersected. **Items can appear more than once**.

## AnagramGrouper

Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

## KDiffPairs

Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the number of unique k-diff pairs in the array. Here a k-diff pair is defined as an integer pair (i, j), where i and j are both numbers in the array and their absolute difference is k.

## TwoSum

Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have ***exactly*** one solution.

## AnagramValidity

Checks given 2 strings are anagram or not without using sorting the input.
