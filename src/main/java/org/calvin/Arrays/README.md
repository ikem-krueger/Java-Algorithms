## AnagramCounter.java

Checks how far apart 2 given strings are from being anagram

## AnagramValidity.java

Checks given 2 strings are anagram or not.

## AnagramGrouper.java

Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

## CheckIfArrayElementsAreConsecutive.java

Checks if all the numbers in the array are consecutive.

## ContainsDuplicate.java

Checks if input int array has any duplicate item.

## DuplicateWithinkIndices.java

Checks if input int array has any duplicate item within a set of window.

## FindDuplicates

Given an array *nums* containing *n* + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and *n* (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

**Note**:

1. You **must not** modify the array (assume the array is read only).
2. You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
3. Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n<sup>2</sup>).
4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

## Intersection.java

Given 2 int arrays, returns 1 array that contains all items intersected.

## Intersection2.java

Given 2 int arrays, returns 1 array that contains all items intersected. Items can appear more than once.

## LongestConsecutive.java

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

## MajorityElement.java

Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

## MergeSortedArray.java

Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

## MoveZeros.java

Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

## RemoveDuplicateSortedArray.java

Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

## RemoveElement.java

Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

## Rotate.java

Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.

For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].

## SlidingWindowMaximum.java

Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.
