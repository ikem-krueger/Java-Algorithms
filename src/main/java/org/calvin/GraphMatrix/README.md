## Dijkstra

Dijkstra algorithm which is to search shortest path in a graph that carries edge with a weight.

## BfsDfs

Breadth First Search vs Depth First Search using Graphs. It shows the differences between the 2 in one class.

## Graph

Contains Nodes to create a graph

## Node

Node to carry state, children and the value

## NumIslands

Count number of consecutive islands in a 2D matrix.

## SpiralGrid

You are given a 2D array of integers. Print out the clockwise spiral traversal of the matrix.

**Example**:
```
grid = [[1,  2,  3,  4,  5],
        [6,  7,  8,  9,  10],
        [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
        [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]]

The clockwise spiral traversal of this array is:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 11, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 13, 12
```

## State

Enum to show different state of the graph

## TwoDMatrixBFS

Search the goal from the source in 2D matrix
