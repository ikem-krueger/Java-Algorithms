## AddBinary

Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).

For example,  
a = `"11"`  
b = `"1"`  
Return `"100"`.

## NumberOf1Bit

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation `00000000000000000000000000001011`, so the function should return 3.

## ReverseBit

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

For example,  
given input 43261596 (represented in binary as **00000010100101000001111010011100**),  
return 964176192 (represented in binary as **00111001011110000010100101000000**).
