### Adapter

Convert the interface of a class into another interface the clients
expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise
because of incompatible interfaces.

### Composite

Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
Composite lets client treat individual objects and compositions of objects
uniformly.

### Decorator

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators
provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionalities

### Facade

Provide an unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade
defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use

### Flyweight

Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
