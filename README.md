[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/stalk-calvin/Java-Algorithms/badge.svg?branch=)](https://coveralls.io/github/stalk-calvin/Java-Algorithms?branch=master)

This is where I play and learn different kind of algorithms, data structures, concepts, techniques, etc. Anything related to Programming. Most of the problems included are basics for now which I personally find important. I plan to continue contributing more problems here for the future.

## Contribute

It's easy to find a mistake in the repository. They are literally everywhere!

When you spot a mistake needs correction, please do not hesitate to create a `Pull Request` as instructed below:

1. Create a personal fork of this Java Playground project on Github.
2. Clone the fork on your local machine (the remote `origin`). If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
4. Create a new branch to work on (`git checkout -b`)! Branch from `master` (no `develop` here :p).
5. Implement/fix the algorithms/tests, comment your code where applicable.
6. Please write/adapt unit tests as needed.
7. Add or change the documentation as needed.
8. Squash your commits into a single commit for relevant changes.
9. Push your branch to your fork on Github (the remote `origin`).
10. From your fork open a pull request. Target this project's `master` branch. *ex) into stalk-calvin:master from bumblebee:knapsack01_bug*

Note: Always write your commit messages in the present tense.
Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code - not what you did to the code.

## How many algorithms?

There are roughly 535 java algorithms exists with 827 test cases.
