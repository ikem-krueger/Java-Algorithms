This is where I play and learn different kind of algorithms, data structures, concepts, techniques, etc. Anything related to Programming. Most of the problems included are basics for now which I personally find important. I plan to continue contributing more problems here for the future.

## Contribute

It's easy to find a mistake in the repository. They are literally everywhere!

When you spot a mistake needs correction, please do not hesitate to create a `Pull Request` as instructed below:

1. Create a local clone of the repository / pull to the latest changes.
5. Create a new branch to work on (`git checkout -b`)! Branch from `master` (no `develop` here :p).
6. Introduce a new algorithm OR correction to the existing one.
7. Please write/adapt unit tests and run them!
8. Add or change the documentation as needed.
9. Push your branch. Open a pull request targeting the project's master branch!

Note: Always write your commit messages in the present tense.
Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code - not what you did to the code.

## How many algorithms?

There are roughly 536 java algorithms exists with 830 test cases.
